# Industrial-Copper-Modeling

## Introduction:

The Industrial Copper Modeling project focuses on predicting the selling price and status (won or lost) in the industrial copper market using machine learning regression and classification algorithms. By exploring the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing, and applying various machine learning techniques, we aim to develop models that can accurately predict the selling price and status in the copper market.

## Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about industrial copper transactions, including variables such as selling price, quantities, and status (won or lost). It provides a comprehensive view of the copper market and factors that influence the outcomes of transactions.

## Project Learnings:

The main learnings from this project are as follows:

* Exploring Skewness and Outliers
* Data Transformation and Cleaning
* Machine Learning Regression Algorithms
* Machine Learning Classification Algorithms
* Evaluation and Model Selection

## Key Technologies and Skills:

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-Learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Pickle
* Streamlit

In this project, we have successfully developed a pipeline to preprocess industrial copper data, handle missing values, detect outliers, and address skewness. We have also built regression and classification models to predict the selling price and determine if a sale was won or lost. The trained models have been saved as a pickle file for easy retrieval. The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface to utilize the trained model for making predictions.
